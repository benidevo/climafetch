# climafetch
 ClimaFetch dynamically collects daily weather data using OpenWeatherMap, triggered by Google Cloud Pub/Sub and scheduled via Cloud Scheduler. It processes and stores this information in a GCP-managed Redis cluster, ensuring rapid access for applications needing real-time weather updates.
